## Task1

Create component in ./app/Task1/index.js. It should send request to backend using `Fetch API` and then render "block#1" with result (Look at ./server/index.js! You can find
some list to use in the task).
Component should show "block#2" while waiting response.

Examples "block#1" and "block#2" at /screenshots



1. Install dependencies
`yarn install` (or `npm install`)

2. Run webpack
`yarn watch` (or `npm run watch`)

3. Run server
`yarn server` (or `npm run server`)

4. Run client by selecting *public/index.html* file and starting live server   
   or by `npx http-server` command
